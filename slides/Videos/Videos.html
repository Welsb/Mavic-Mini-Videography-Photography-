		  <dt>Hawthorne Trail</dt>
		  <p>Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail stretches 16 miles from the city of Gainesville's Boulware Springs Park through the Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park and other local and state conservation lands.

On this historic rail-bed turned greenway you will pass by native plants and wildlife, diverse scenery and backyard Florida culture. Overlooks and stops of interest tie together a rich story of small railroad towns, locomotives and human activity along this corridor. </p>

		  <dt>Newnans Lake</dt>
		  <p>Newnans Lake State Forest contains over 1,000 acres of natural lands just east of Gainesville in Alachua County. This property has been in state ownership since 1921 when 3,000 acres were acquired to establish a residential farm community for Floridians with developmental disabilities. Over the years, parts of the 3,000 acre property were transferred to other state and local agencies. In January 2015, 1,005 acres of undeveloped land were assigned to the Florida Forest Service to manage as a state forest.</p>

		 <dt>Paynes Prairie</dt>
		 <p>Not just found out west, herds of wild horses and bison roam the prairie in this surprisingly diverse preserve south of Gainesville.

Paynes Prairie is unique in many ways. Nowhere else in Florida can visitors experience wild-roaming bison and horses. Nearly 300 species of birds also frequent the park along with alligators, deer and many other animals.

The park’s eight trails, including the 16-mile paved Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail, allows one to explore the park’s interior and observe wildlife, while a 50-foot high observation tower provides for panoramic views.

Fishing and canoeing on Lake Wauberg is popular along with a shaded campground. During a visit to Paynes Prairie, one can easily understand why Seminole Indians once occupied a village along this vast savannah. </p>
